my js experiments + whatever

### [Modified bush test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rbush)

A test of a modified version of the [rbush library](https://github.com/mourner/rbush). My version very simply adds element movement.

### [Rect collider test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rectCollider/)

A test of RectCollider, a physics library focused on exact collision (no out of place object penetration) and allowing the creation of a "hierarchy of weights", defining who can affect who's trajectory simply.
