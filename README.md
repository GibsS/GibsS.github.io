my js experiments + whatever

### [Gridlike testbed](https://gibss.github.io/test/gridlike)

A simple web page that showcases my physics engine: gridlike. Its a typescript library with a focus on being very simple to bootstrap and use to make web 2D platformers and terraria-likes.

Checkout the different scripts and follow the instructions, you'll quickly get a sense of the scope of the library.

### [Gridlike-Unity demo](https://gibss.github.io/test/gridlike-unity/Gridship3/)

A demo of the unity version of gridlike. There is a small (see tiny) amount of gameplay but this showcases a few of the things you can do with gridlike.

Just like its typescript counterpart above, the library serves as foundation to make terraria likes, 2D platformers with a focus on destructible (or buildable) tile based terrain.

### [Space battle v2](http://space-battle-v2.herokuapp.com/#/board)

An improved prototype for a digital TCG. The players create their own fleet of space ships and fight in a simultaneous-turn-based game.

### [Hexagon world generation](https://gibss.github.io/test/RAE-world-generation)

A web page that showcases a procedural generation library that creates top down hex world maps.

### [Modified bush test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rbush)

A test of a modified version of the [rbush library](https://github.com/mourner/rbush). My version very simply adds element movement.

### [Rect collider test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rectCollider/)

A test of RectCollider, a physics library focused on exact collision (no object penetration) and allowing the creation of a "hierarchy of weights", defining who can affect who's trajectory simply.

The library is still at a very experimental stage and requires the handling of a few edge cases. However, it can still be tested and used as is.

### [Space vagrant - space battle](https://space-vagrant-prototype.herokuapp.com/#/board)

The predecessor to the space battle game above.

A digital 'card game' with mechanics inspired from FTL. Each player own a set
of ships with unique sets of 'systems' and must choose which of them to use to
take down the enemy ships. The game is heavily centered around a 'hiding'
mechanic which prevents players from knowing what their adversary own, adding a
mind game element.

This is a simple web based prototype to test out the core mechanics and try to
find a right balance for future iterations.

### [Pet bot client](https://gibss.github.io/test/pet-bot-client/)

[The server is down]
A client for an online chat bot of my making. The bot is build using a trained sequence to sequence machine learning model. Have a go at it!
Might require cloning the repository and running it locally as their might be CORS issues.
