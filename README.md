my js experiments + whatever

### [Modified bush test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rbush)

A test of a modified version of the [rbush library](https://github.com/mourner/rbush). My version very simply adds element movement.

### [Rect collider test](https://gibss.github.io/test/rectCollider/)

A test of RectCollider, a physics library focused on exact collision (no out of place object penetration) and allowing the creation of a "hierarchy of weights", defining who can affect who's trajectory simply.

The library is still at a very experimental stage and requires the handling of a few edge cases. However, it can still be tested and used as is.

### [Space vagrant-ship battle](https://space-vagrant-prototype.herokuapp.com/#/board)

A digital 'card game' with mechanics inspired from FTL. Each player own a set
of ships with unique sets of 'systems' and must choose which of them to use to
take down the enemy ships. The game is heavily centered around a 'hiding'
mechanic which prevents players from knowing what their adversary own, adding a
mind game element.

This is a simple web based prototype to test out the core mechanics and try to
find a right balance for future iterations.

### [Pet bot client](https://gibss.github.io/test/pet-bot-client/)

A client for an online chat bot of my making. The bot is build using a trained sequence to sequence machine learning model. Have a go at it!
